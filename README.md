# Using-Spotify-API
This is the first instance in which i use a public API such as Spotify, saddly the recommendations port is disabled but ill keep updating this repository so it can achieve its original purpose

first of all youll need to set up a node enviroment so download node
then in your console cd to the project folder and type "npm i"
once installed youll need some npm packages
"npm axios"
"npm ejs"
"npm express"
optional ---------------
"npm nodemon"

after that youll need a spotify token wich you can get by following the instruction in this link: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
and after you get you ID and your secret put it in the ClientID and ClientSecret variables inside the index.js

after 2 clicks in the send button you sould get the song you type
